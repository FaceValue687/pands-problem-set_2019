FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF SYNTAX:
1.Variable names can contain both letters and numbers, but can't start with a number; keywords can't be used as variable names.
2. The assignment statement produces no output in a script mode.
3. In general, statement don't have values.
4. Order of operation for expressions containing more than one operator is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Substruction.
