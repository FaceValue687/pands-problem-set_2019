FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF BASIC SYNTAX
1. Variable names can contain both letters and numbers, but can't start with a number; keywords can't be used as variable names.
2. The assignment statement produces no output in a script mode.
3. In general, statement don't have values.
4. Order of operation for expressions containing more than one operator is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Substruction.
5. Almost anywhere you can put a value you can put an arbitrary expresssion, but the left side of the statement has to be a variable name.
